## Role Variables

Here you find a description of all input variables (i.e. variables that are defined in
`defaults/main.yml`) for the role as these form the API of the role. The following code block shows all necessary input variables and their default values. They are specified in `defaults/main.yml`.

```yaml
pam_pwd_minlen: "12" # defines the minimum acceptable size for a password.
pam_pwd_history: "5" # defines the number of previous passwords which cannot be used.
pam_pwd_dcredit: "-1" # defines minimum credit for having required digits in password.
pam_pwd_ucredit: "-1" # defines minimum credit for having uppercase characters in password.
pam_pwd_lcredit: "-1" # defines minimum credit for having lowercase characters in password.
pam_pwd_ocredit: "-1" # defines minimum credit for having other characters in password.
pam_pwd_minclass: "4" # defines minium number of required character classes in new password.
pam_pwd_enforce_root: "enforce_for_root" # (""|"enforce_for_root") defines whether or not to enforce password complexity for user root.
pam_pwd_policy_name: "password-policy" # RHEL 8 only. Define name of the custom authselect profile.
pam_pwd_deny: "5" # Set the number of failed login attempts after which the account is locked.
pam_pwd_unlock_time: "300" # Time in seconds after which an account is unlocked again.

You can keep these default values if they fit your requirements. Or you can overwrite the defaults by specifiny some or all of them in places like `vars/main.yml`, `group_vars/`, `host_vars/` or your playbook.
